title: tw-did Additional Information

In the previous article, I mentioned that the collaboration structure of this project is somewhat complex. Every time someone asks me about it, I have to spend a lot of time explaining, so I'm writing it down here so that in the future I can just direct people to read this short article.

The origin of this project was actually a contract bid issued by the Ministry of Digital Affairs (MODA), which was won by the Frontier Foundation. Most of the members from the Frontier Foundation participating in this contract came from the DA0 community. This contract actually included many projects, one of which was the verification project connecting W3C DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and the Mobile Citizen Digital Certificate - the open-source project I'm involved in. However, **I did not participate in the contract bid** - this is where it gets complicated ðŸ˜Ž

As mentioned earlier, I was invited by the Ethereum Foundation and accepted their Grant Program. This was because some enthusiastic individuals within the foundation believed that such integration opportunities between **decentralized identity** and government agencies are very rare, and they hoped to achieve this through open-source methods that serve the public interest. After discussions, the foundation decided to provide **technical support** for this project. The method of this technical support was to find a suitable person through the Grant Program to be responsible for planning and implementing this project, and that's how I became involved.

So under this technical support framework, I accepted the Ethereum Foundation's Grant Program to provide technical support for this project, including design, planning, and development, ultimately delivering the source code to the Frontier Foundation to complete the contract. I did not develop this project alone - several other developers also participated in frontend development, deployment, and other work. For details, please see the [contributors section of the README](https://github.com/moda-gov-tw/tw-did?tab=readme-ov-file#contributors).

From my perspective, I participated in an open-source project and received a grant from the Ethereum Foundation. I have no contractual relationship with the Frontier Foundation and did not participate in the contract bid. I was merely a participant in an Ethereum Foundation grant program, providing technical support and developing an open-source project.

This grant program ended at the end of December. After it ended, in mid-January, Doni from the Ministry of Digital Affairs asked if I was interested in providing a two-week technical feasibility assessment for the upcoming **Taiwan Digital Identity Wallet draft**. At that point, I participated as a consultant in the MODA draft technical assessment, and this consulting work also ended at the end of January.

So if you heard that Noah from DA0 was responsible for this project, that's correct. Noah was primarily responsible for most of the coordination work, publicity, and exchange activities in this project. If you also heard that the Ethereum Foundation sponsored this development work, that's also correct, because I participated in the planning and development of this project as technical support.

I hope this explanation helps everyone understand this complex collaboration relationship ðŸ¤£

As we drive through the Hsuehshan Tunnel toward Toucheng, we always talk about the small things in life. Sometimes we discuss how the light slants through the window and illuminates the rattan chair, sometimes we talk about the podcast by the flower shop owner in Yilan, and sometimes we discuss trivial matters that seem to trouble only us in the entire world.

Usually, before we reach any conclusions, we've already taken the elevator to the top floor, greeted the owner Natalie, and pulled out chairs to sit down at Nectar Coffee. The conversation isn't over yet, but now we're agonizing over what coffee to order today—whether those ten circles on that limited edition coffee we both wanted have already been filled with other customers' names, or whether we can secretly delight in signing our name in the last remaining circle.

The conversation continues. The owner joins the discussion, steering it in even more open-ended directions while serving coffee so delicious it makes our eyes widen and leaves us speechless. And so the topics branch out and continue right up until the moment before we head home.

Since there are never any answers, Nectar Coffee, which initially seemed like our destination, always becomes part of the journey instead.

Last month when I visited Nectar Coffee, I told Natalie that I'd be going to Tokyo for work. After her surprise, we exchanged many thoughts about life. Life is fluid, a series of choices with no right or wrong answers. Every decision we make at each crossroads offers no chance to start over. Rather than dwelling on regret and remorse, it's better to accept that no one has the omniscient eye to see through every possible outcome at every fork in the road. Tell yourself that in that moment, you made the best decision you could.

All that's left is to learn to appreciate the scenery along the journey.

Recently, Nectar Coffee posted an announcement. The last day of business would be in one week. I'm happy that Natalie has announced her own decision, and I've thoroughly enjoyed every moment spent in this rooftop café. We tried singing bowls together, discussed the musicality and colors in the taste of coffee, watched a friend grimace through a video conference while drinking on the balcony with its spectacular view of Turtle Mountain Island, I envied my friend pressing the shutter of their GR film camera here, and we talked about the emotions stirred by *Perfect Days*.

At first, as we drove through the Hsuehshan Tunnel, Nectar always felt like a destination, but it was never just that. When we waved goodbye at dusk, it had already transformed from a destination into a beautiful journey that my friends and I would treasure.

When I walked into a café in Kichijoji and received a stamp card with circles drawn on it, I couldn't help but smile. I understood then that in this moment, Nectar Coffee had embarked on a new journey together with me.

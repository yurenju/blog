My account was removed from the previous project's organization. An era has ended, but it also marks the beginning of another chapter.

I've been reading a book about wabi-sabi lately (perhaps not the interior design style you might imagine). One passage discussed observing the creation and dissolution of things, attempting to appreciate the beauty in these transitions. The example given was of ancient travelers who would cut rushes and bind them together to shelter for a night in the wilderness. The next morning, they would untie the ropes holding their temporary refuge, and the camp would simply dissolve back into the wild.

The rushes scattered in a circle on the wilderness floor would gradually be carried away by the wind, consumed and decomposed by bacteria in the soil. This kind of beauty is wabi-sabi—the essence of "death and rebirth."

When the rushes were cut by the traveler, their life as plants ended, yet they were reborn as a new form: a shelter. The next day, once the ropes were untied, the camp disintegrated again, and eventually all those remnants would become the foundation for something new.

Life is the same way. When something ends, its traces slowly fade. But the nutrients left behind after decay always nourish the sprouting of something else. If you can appreciate this kind of transition, that too is a form of wabi-sabi.
